## Repository Branch Organization

This repository is organized so that a student can quickly switch to any lesson state on-demand. A lesson has two primary states: Project Exercise or Project Dapp. If a Project Exercise or Project Dapp has interim states, they are indicated with a numeric suffix (no suffix indicates no interim states). 

The naming convention used for repository branches is thus:

`Project7/Exercise-(XNN || Final)`

Examples: 
* Project7/Exercise-A01
* Project7/Exercise-B01, Project7/Exercise-B02

`Project7/Dapp-(XNN || Final)`

Examples: 
* Project7/Dapp-A01
* Project7/Dapp-C01, Project7/Dapp-C02

## Lesson States

* Project 7 - Exercise A01 : Scaffolding, Variables and Modifiers
* Project 7 - Exercise A02 : Control Functions and Modifier Use
* Project 7 - Exercise A03 : Test Control Functions and Modifiers
* Project 7 - Dapp A01 : Register Airline
* Project 7 - Dapp A02 : Test Airline Registration
