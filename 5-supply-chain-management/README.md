# Build your own Notarization API with Ethereum Blockchain & IPFS

Learn Blockchain architecture and gain insights regarding the process to adapt legacy systems with the layering of Blockchain services. We will advance our skillsets with smart contracts utilizing IPFS and the Ethereum network.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system

## Built With

* [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/) - Ethereum is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts
* [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) - IPFS is the Distributed Web | A peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol
to make the web faster, safer, and more open.
* [Truffle Framework](http://truffleframework.com/) - Truffle is the most popular development framework for Ethereum with a mission to make your life a whole lot easier.
